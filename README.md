# Data Science Portfolio

Repository containing portfolio of data science projects completed by me for academic, self learning, and hobby purposes.
Presented in the form of iPython Notebooks, and Python codes.

_Note: Data used in the projects (accessed under data directory) is for demonstration purposes only._

## Content
- ### Machine Learning

    - [Supervised Learning: Machine Learning multi-class, multi-label classifier 
with Random Forest](https://github.com/MahdiDavari/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/ML_Micro_Projects/ML%20with%20Random%20Forest%20(muli-class%2C%20multi-label%20classifier).py):
Random Forest is nothing more than a bunch of Decision Trees combined. They can handle categorical features very well.
This algorithm can handle high dimensional spaces as well as large number of training examples.
Random Forests can almost work out of the box and that is one reason why they are very popular.

   _Tools: scikit-learn, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, NLTK, Re_
    
    - [Supervised Learning: Phony article detection with Machine Learning (based on its link and title)](https://github.com/MahdiDavari/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/ML_Micro_Projects/ML%20with%20Random%20Forest%20(Article%20classification%20based%20on%20link%20and%20title).ipynb):
A model is trained to detect phony article based on its link and title. Links are parsed with urlparser from urllib library.
 Length of the link, netloc and the title are used as features to train a supervised learning Random Forest classifier model
  to detect whether an article is phony or not.
  
  _Tools: urlparse, scikit-learn, Pandas, NLTK_

    
- ### Natural Language Processing
    - [Text classification using NLTK](https://github.com/MahdiDavari/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/ML_Micro_Projects/ML%20with%20Random%20Forest%20(muli-class%2C%20multi-label%20classifier).py): 
    Using Natural Language Toolkit, I built a classification system for text inputs.
